abstract = "In this paper, we propose an adaptive step-size control algorithm for solving nonlinear Schrödinger’s equations. The proposed algorithm has a fourth-order local accuracy and is a system-independent rule for adjusting the step sizes. This algorithm has two potential advantages, an automatic step adjustment mechanism and higher-order accuracy. A test example shows that, by comparing to the fixed step-size method and the local-error method, our method decreases the computational time by about 10 and 70 times, respectively. The performance of the proposed method is validated and compared to commonly used step-size selection methods by simulating the evolution of a third-order soliton, the collision of a fundamental soliton pair, and the supercontinuum generation. Numerical simulations show that the proposed method can increase the computational efficiency by more than one and two orders of magnitude in comparison with the symmetrized split-step Fourier method. In addition, the computational efficiency is improved with the increase of the accuracy of solutions."

abstract = "Many of the static and dynamic properties of an atomic Bose–Einstein condensate (BEC) are usually studied by solving the mean-field Gross–Pitaevskii (GP) equation, which is a nonlinear partial differential equation for short-range atomic interaction. More recently, BEC of atoms with long-range dipolar atomic interaction are used in theoretical and experimental studies. For dipolar atomic interaction, the GP equation is a partial integro-differential equation, requiring complex algorithm for its numerical solution. Here we present numerical algorithms for both stationary and non-stationary solutions of the full three-dimensional (3D) GP equation for a dipolar BEC, including the contact interaction. We also consider the simplified one- (1D) and two-dimensional (2D) GP equations satisfied by cigar- and disk-shaped dipolar BECs. We employ the split-step Crank–Nicolson method with real- and imaginary-time propagations, respectively, for the numerical solution of the GP equation for dynamic and static properties of a dipolar BEC. The atoms are considered to be polarized along the z axis and we consider ten different cases, e.g., stationary and non-stationary solutions of the GP equation for a dipolar BEC in 1D (along x and z axes), 2D (in x–y and x–z planes), and 3D, and we provide working codes in Fortran 90/95 and C for these ten cases (twenty programs in all). We present numerical results for energy, chemical potential, root-mean-square sizes and density of the dipolar BECs and, where available, compare them with results of other authors and of variational and Thomas–Fermi approximations.

abstract={We present an improved Quantum Lattice Gas (QLG) algorithm as a mesoscopic unitary perturbative representation of the mean field Gross Pitaevskii (GP) equation for Bose–Einstein Condensates (BECs). The method employs an interleaved sequence of unitary collide and stream operators. QLG is applicable to many different scalar potentials in the weak interaction regime and has been used to model the Korteweg–de Vries (KdV), Burgers and GP equations. It can be implemented on both quantum and classical computers and is extremely scalable. We present results for 1D soliton solutions with positive and negative internal interactions, as well as vector solitons with inelastic scattering. In higher dimensions we look at the behavior of vortex ring reconnection. A further improvement is considered with a proper operator splitting technique via a Fourier transformation. This is great for quantum computers since the quantum FFT is exponentially faster than its classical counterpart which involves non-local data on the entire lattice (Quantum FFT is the backbone of the Shor algorithm for quantum factorization). We also present an imaginary time method in which we transform the Schrödinger equation into a diffusion equation for recovering ground state initial conditions of a quantum system suitable for the QLG algorithm.},
